GabrielECoy: Explain how the line 127 "tools=[get_weather_forecast]" works. What's does "[get_weather_forecast]" refers to and it's relationship with @function_tool

GitHub Copilot: I will create a short todo list to track the explanation steps, then I'll explain how `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` works, show runtime flow, introspection snippets, and common edge cases. I'll update the todo list when finished.

Created 4 todos

Progress update — I created the todo list and set the first item in-progress. Now I'll explain how `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` works and the relationship with `@function_tool`.

## Short answer
- `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` passes a list containing the Python object named `get_weather_forecast` to the `Agent`. It does not call the function — it hands the function (or a function-wrapper/tool-object created by the decorator) to the agent so the agent can use that callable as a "tool".
- The `@function_tool` decorator transforms or annotates the plain Python function into a tool descriptor/wrapper (for example, adding metadata like name, description, parameter schema, and/or registering it). That decorated object is what the agent uses to tell the LLM "this tool exists and how to call it" and to actually invoke it at runtime when the LLM requests it.

## What "[get_weather_forecast]" refers to (technical)
- In Python, `[get_weather_forecast]` is a list literal whose single element is the object bound to the name `get_weather_forecast`.
- Because `get_weather_forecast` is defined with `@function_tool`, the name refers to whatever the decorator returned. Common decorator behaviors:
  - It could return the original function but with extra attributes attached (e.g., `.name`, `.description`, `.parameters`).
  - It could return a new wrapper object that is callable (so it still behaves like a function) but also carries metadata or registration behavior.
  - It could also register the function in a global tool registry and return the original function or a proxy.

So `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` hands the Agent a list of tool objects (or callables-with-metadata). The Agent expects each item to include both a callable (so it can be executed) and enough metadata to describe the tool to the LLM.

## Relationship between `@function_tool` and Agent tool list
- Purpose of the decorator:
  - Create or attach metadata needed for "tool calling" (name, description, parameter types/schema).
  - Possibly convert the function signature into a JSON schema or another format that the LLM can use to form valid tool-call arguments.
  - Optionally register the tool globally so other agents or runners can discover it.
- Purpose of `tools=[...]` in Agent:
  - The Agent collects those metadata objects and sends them to the LLM (as "available functions/tools"). The LLM can then decide to call a tool and return a structured tool-call describing which tool and what arguments.
  - At runtime, when the LLM requests a tool call, the Runner or Agent maps that request back to the actual callable (the same Python object you passed in the `tools` list) and executes it.

## Typical runtime flow (simple step-by-step)
1. At agent creation, `Agent(..., tools=[get_weather_forecast])` stores the tool objects and extracts their metadata (name, params, description).
2. When you call the agent (via `Runner.run_sync`), the Agent gives the LLM the user prompt plus the list of available tools (their metadata/schemas).
3. The LLM may return a normal text response or a structured "call tool" output (e.g., "call `get_weather_forecast` with args {city: 'X'}").
4. The Runner detects the structured tool call, finds the corresponding callable (the object you passed in the `tools` list), and calls it with the parsed arguments.
5. The function executes (makes the API call, does logic), returns a result (string or structured data).
6. Runner sends that result back into the conversation context so the LLM can continue reasoning or produce the final reply.

## How to inspect the actual tool object at runtime
Run small introspection snippets (in your environment or a REPL) to see what the decorator produced:

- Basic identity and doc:
  - print(get_weather_forecast)
  - print(get_weather_forecast.__name__)
  - print(get_weather_forecast.__doc__)
- See attributes added by decorator:
  - print(dir(get_weather_forecast))
  - print(getattr(get_weather_forecast, "name", None))
  - print(getattr(get_weather_forecast, "description", None))
  - print(getattr(get_weather_forecast, "parameters", None))
- If decorator wrapped the function (common), you may see `.func` or `.__wrapped__`:
  - print(getattr(get_weather_forecast, "__wrapped__", None))
- If it registered globally, check the registry in the `agents` module (open `agents.py`) — the decorator might call something like `agents.register_tool(...)`.

These introspection prints are already hinted at in your file (the commented-out block that prints `get_weather_forecast` and `vars(get_weather_forecast)`).

## Mini "contract" for this tool (useful to document)
- Inputs: city (string) — a place identifier the function will send to the weather API.
- Output: a string with a human-readable weather report (or a structured object; currently returns a string).
- Error behavior: returns a string describing the error (e.g., network/API error) rather than raising.

## Common edge cases and recommendations
- The decorator must produce metadata that matches the function signature; if the model builds arguments incompatible with the signature, the Runner must validate or fail gracefully.
- Environment variables: `WEATHER_API_KEY` must be present; otherwise the tool should detect missing key and return a clear error (instead of crashing).
- Network errors/timeouts: catch and return friendly error messages (your code already does this).
- Argument types: ensure the tool can handle ambiguous place names (e.g., "Springfield") or add a parameter schema so the LLM asks for clarification.
- Security: avoid logging or returning secrets within the tool output.
- Testing: add a small unit test for the tool function to assert correct behavior on normal and error paths.

## Quick example of how the Agent uses the list (pseudocode)
- Agent initialization:
  - for tool in tools:
    - extract tool.name, tool.description, tool.parameters
    - add to model "functions" list
- During run:
  - if model returns "tool_call":
    - selected_tool = find tool in tools by name
    - result = selected_tool(**parsed_args)
    - inject result back to model as system/user message

## Recommendation: check the `agents` module
Open `agents.py` to read the implementation of `function_tool` and Agent/Runner to see exactly what metadata and wrapper form are used. That will tell you whether `@function_tool` returns the original function with attributes, a wrapper object, or registers the function elsewhere.

Progress update — I've completed the explanation and provided introspection and edge cases. I'll now mark the todo list items as completed.

Completed (1/4) *Plan explanation*

Done — all todo items marked completed. If you want, I can:
- Open `agents.py` and show the exact `function_tool` implementation (so we know precisely what metadata it provides).
- Add a tiny unit test that introspects the decorated tool and asserts expected metadata exists. Which would you prefer next?

GabrielECoy: The first option

GitHub Copilot: I'll locate and open the project's `agents.py` to show the exact `@function_tool` implementation and explain it (outcome: paste the relevant code and a concise explanation). I'll first create a short todo plan, then search for `agents.py`, then read it.

Created 3 todos

Searched for files matching `**/agents.py`, no matches

Now I'll search the workspace for the symbol `function_tool` (to find where it's defined). Expected outcome: file path(s) that define or reference the decorator.

Searched text for `function_tool`, 50 results

Searched text for `def function_tool`, 6 results

I'll open the installed package implementation at venv's site-packages (tool.py) to read the `function_tool` definition and nearby code so I can explain exactly what it does. Expected outcome: show the decorator code and immediate context.

Read [](file:///workspaces/build-with-ai-creating-ai-agents-with-gpt-5/venv/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/agents/tool.py)

Starting (3/3) *Explain decorator*

Progress update — I opened the installed `agents` package code at tool.py and located the `function_tool` implementation. Next I'll explain exactly how that code makes `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` work, referencing the implementation.

## What `@function_tool` does (exact behavior from the code)
- The decorator is implemented as the `function_tool` function in tool.py. It supports both usages:
  - @function_tool (no parentheses) — in that case the decorator receives the function directly and returns a FunctionTool instance.
  - @function_tool(...) (with options) — returns a decorator that accepts the function and returns a FunctionTool instance.
- When applied to a function, the decorator builds a FunctionTool dataclass instance. Key fields:
  - name: derived from the function (via `function_schema`), used as the tool name shown to the LLM.
  - description: from docstring or overrides.
  - params_json_schema: a JSON schema produced from the function signature (via `function_schema`), used to tell the LLM what parameters and types the tool accepts.
  - on_invoke_tool: an async callable that accepts a ToolContext and a JSON string input. This is the runtime entry point the Runner calls to execute the tool.
  - strict_json_schema and is_enabled: control validation/enabling behavior.

## How that turns your `get_weather_forecast` into a tool
- In your file you wrote:
  @function_tool
  def get_weather_forecast(city: str):
      ...
- At import time, `get_weather_forecast` is replaced with the return value of the decorator — a `FunctionTool` instance (not the original plain Python function).
- So the name `get_weather_forecast` in the module refers to a `FunctionTool` object. Therefore:
  - `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` is passing a list containing a FunctionTool object to `Agent`, not the raw function.

You can confirm this at runtime by checking:
- type(get_weather_forecast)  -> should be `agents.tool.FunctionTool` (or similar)
- get_weather_forecast.name  -> the tool name exposed to the LLM
- get_weather_forecast.params_json_schema  -> the JSON schema for arguments
- get_weather_forecast.on_invoke_tool  -> async callable used by Runner to invoke the original function

(Your file already has a commented-out snippet that prints `get_weather_forecast` and `vars(get_weather_forecast)` — that will show the dataclass fields.)

## Exactly how a tool call flows at runtime (based on the implementation)
1. Agent is created with `tools=[get_weather_forecast]`. It will gather these FunctionTool objects and send their metadata (name, description, params_json_schema) to the LLM as available functions/tools.
2. The model may respond with a structured "call this tool" message, providing arguments as JSON.
3. The Runner detects the tool call and invokes the corresponding FunctionTool's `on_invoke_tool(ctx, input_json_string)`.
4. `on_invoke_tool` does:
   - parse the JSON input string,
   - validate and coerce params using a pydantic model created by `function_schema` (it raises a ModelBehaviorError if invalid),
   - convert parsed pydantic model into args and kwargs via `schema.to_call_args(parsed)`,
   - call the original underlying function (supports async and sync functions, and functions that accept a context as the first argument),
   - catch exceptions and, if provided, convert them to user-friendly messages via `failure_error_function` (so the LLM receives an error string instead of a hard crash) and attaches tracing for diagnostics.
5. The function's return value is returned by `on_invoke_tool` to the Runner, which then injects it back into the LLM conversation so the model can continue reasoning.

## Key practical consequences for your code
- get_weather_forecast is a FunctionTool object. Passing it as `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` gives the Agent both the ability to tell the model how to call the tool (JSON schema) and a callable path (on_invoke_tool) to run your Python code when the model requests it.
- The LLM will construct arguments using the `params_json_schema` the decorator created. That schema is strict by default (strict_mode=True), which reduces misformatted tool calls.
- Error handling is graceful: exceptions inside your function will be converted to strings (unless you set `failure_error_function=None`, which would re-raise the exception).
- The decorator supports functions that expect a context parameter (RunContextWrapper / ToolContext) as the first arg — the wrapper handles calling with the appropriate context.

## Quick runtime introspection snippets you can run in your script/REPL
- print(type(get_weather_forecast))
- print(get_weather_forecast.name)
- import json; print(json.dumps(get_weather_forecast.params_json_schema, indent=2))
- print(callable(get_weather_forecast.on_invoke_tool))  # True; it's an async function

## Where to look next (optional)
- If you want exact wiring for how Agent/Runner serializes the FunctionTool to the model and invokes `on_invoke_tool`, I can open agent.py and `.../runner.py` (or the package equivalents) and show the code that uses `FunctionTool`. Would you like me to open those as well?

Done — I also updated the todo progress (two tasks completed, explanation in-progress). I'll mark the final todo completed once you confirm you don't need further file-level details.

GabrielECoy: Continue with the last task

GitHub Copilot: I'll mark the final todo as completed in the task tracker and then finish the detailed explanation of how the `function_tool` decorator works with exact references to the implementation we inspected.

Completed (3/3) *Explain decorator*

Progress update — the todo list is now complete. Below is the finished detailed explanation, referencing the exact behavior in tool.py.

## Direct, implementation-backed explanation

1. What the decorator returns
- When you write:
  @function_tool
  def get_weather_forecast(city: str):
      ...
  the name `get_weather_forecast` in your module is replaced at import-time with the decorator's return value.
- The `function_tool` implementation (agents/tool.py) returns an instance of the dataclass `FunctionTool` (not the raw Python function). You can confirm by checking at runtime:
  - type(get_weather_forecast) -> should be `agents.tool.FunctionTool`
  - get_weather_forecast.name -> the tool name
  - get_weather_forecast.params_json_schema -> the generated JSON schema
  - get_weather_forecast.on_invoke_tool -> async callable that Runner calls to execute the original function

2. How the decorator builds the tool (exact steps from the code)
- function_schema(...) is called to:
  - parse the Python function signature,
  - generate a pydantic model for parameters,
  - build a JSON schema (params_json_schema) describing the tool's arguments,
  - optionally extract descriptions from the function docstring.
  (This is done inside the helper _create_function_tool in the `function_tool` implementation.)
- An async wrapper `_on_invoke_tool_impl` is created. It:
  - parses the JSON string input from the LLM into a dict,
  - validates / constructs a pydantic model instance (schema.params_pydantic_model(**json_data)),
  - converts the pydantic model into call args/kwargs via `schema.to_call_args(parsed)`,
  - calls the original function (`the_func`) with either:
    - (ctx, *args, **kwargs) if the function declares/uses a context argument, or
    - (*args, **kwargs) otherwise,
    and supports both sync and async original functions (uses inspect.iscoroutinefunction to decide).
  - returns the original function’s result to the caller.
- A wrapper `_on_invoke_tool` wraps `_on_invoke_tool_impl` adding exception handling:
  - If an exception occurs it either re-raises (if failure_error_function is None) or calls `failure_error_function(ctx, e)` to produce a user-friendly string to send back to the LLM.
  - The default `failure_error_function` returns a generic message and the code attaches error tracing information.

3. What the returned FunctionTool contains
- The returned `FunctionTool` dataclass contains:
  - name: the tool name (from schema)
  - description: docstring/override
  - params_json_schema: the JSON schema used to instruct the LLM how to call the tool
  - on_invoke_tool: the async callable described above — Runner calls this to execute the tool
  - strict_json_schema: True/False (defaults to True)
  - is_enabled: either a bool or a callable letting you dynamically enable/disable the tool

4. How `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` interacts with Agent/LLM (runtime flow)
- The `Agent` receives a list of `Tool` objects (here, a single `FunctionTool`).
- Agent serializes each tool’s metadata (name, description, params_json_schema) into the model input so the LLM "knows" the available functions and how to call them.
- If the LLM decides to call a tool, the Runner or Agent runtime maps the LLM tool-call (by tool name) back to that `FunctionTool` object and calls `FunctionTool.on_invoke_tool(ctx, input_json_string)`.
- `on_invoke_tool` validates inputs, converts them to call-time args, calls your original function, catches errors and returns the function output (or an error-string) back to the Agent, which then injects that result into the conversation.

5. Practical consequences / gotchas (concrete)
- After decoration the symbol is a `FunctionTool`, so calling get_weather_forecast(...) directly in your module will not call your original function — the `FunctionTool` is what the Agent/Runner expects. If you need direct access to the original function for local tests, check `get_weather_forecast.__wrapped__` or the decorator's preserved attributes (the implementation will preserve the underlying function via the schema and wrapper logic).
- The decorator creates a strict JSON schema by default (strict_mode=True). The LLM will be given that schema to format arguments — strictness reduces bad/tool-call formatting but may require clearer argument shapes.
- The wrapper supports functions that take a context (RunContextWrapper or ToolContext) as the first argument. The wrapper handles passing the context automatically.
- Errors inside your function are handled: by default they are converted to strings via `failure_error_function` and returned to the LLM, rather than throwing a hard exception.

6. Quick runtime introspection you can run in your script/REPL
- print(type(get_weather_forecast))
- print(get_weather_forecast.name)
- import json; print(json.dumps(get_weather_forecast.params_json_schema, indent=2))
- print(callable(get_weather_forecast.on_invoke_tool))

7. If you want the absolute chain details
- We inspected tool.py where `function_tool` is implemented. If you want I can also open the Agent and Runner source in the same package to show precisely where they serialize the FunctionTool into "model functions" and how Runner looks up and calls `on_invoke_tool`. Tell me if you want me to open those files next.

Completion summary — I marked the task tracker entry complete and explained exactly how `@function_tool` turns your function into a `FunctionTool` object, what fields it exposes, and how `tools=[get_weather_forecast]` provides the Agent both the schema the LLM needs and the runtime callable the Runner will execute. Would you like me to show the exact Agent/Runner wiring next?
